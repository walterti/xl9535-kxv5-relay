# xl9535-kxv5-relay
A Python library for jxl XL9535-KxV5 I2C relay boards to be used on Raspbery PI
These chinese boards are sold on 2, 4, 8 and 16 relays versions, in theory the library works on all of them, but i only tested it on a 16 relay board. 
To use this library you will need the NumPY, install it using the "pip install numpy" command
The library usage is pretty simple and an example can be found on example folder.
