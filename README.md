# xl9535-kxv5-relay
## A Python library for jxl XL9535-KxV5 I2C relay boards to be used on Raspbery PI
These chinese boards are sold on 2, 4, 8 and 16 relays versions, in theory the library works on all of them with little modifications, but i only tested it on a 16 relay board.

To use this library you will need the NumPY and smbus, install them using the command
```sh
pip install numpy
pip install smbus
```

The library usage is pretty simple and an example can be found on example folder.
